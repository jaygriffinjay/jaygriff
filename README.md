This is the source code for my website where I publish all my software development work and some personal stuff too!

This website is written entirely in TypeScript using React, Next.js, and Emotion. 

To learn more about this site I would browse the meta docs on the site itself!

## Getting Started
Clone this repo and then:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
